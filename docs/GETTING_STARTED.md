# Telecom Etude Centralised Tool

## Installation

### Requirements

-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
-   [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Setting up the database

For a more detailed explanation, read [database.md](./database.md).

You will need to create a database for this project. You can do so either

-   in your postgresql environment terminal: Install Postgres, then create a local Postgres database and Postgres role with `CREATEDB`, `LOGIN` and `PASSWORD`.
-   With a gui application, such as [pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

With your postgresql login (often `postgres`), database name and password, you can make the database url as such:

```txt
postgresql://your_pg_user:your_pg_password@localhost:5432/your_pg_database_name
```

### Environment variables

> At the end of this step, you can check you have all the variables by looking at `env.d.ts`.

Add the `DB_URL` variable in your `.env.local` file containing the url mentioned above.

> If you just want to test it locally with access to all pages, you can just set `DEV_MODE=true` and enter rubbish in the 3 `AUTH_` variables.

Generate a random `AUTH_SECRET` (e.g. by using `openssl rand -base64 255`), and set up the following environment variables in a `.env.local` file at the root of the project.

You must also generate a Google Secret and ID. To set those up, refer to this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs8018RO5YQ).

Finally, to make tests on your drive, you will need to specify what folder is used by Jet Centre. For that, create a folder in your drive and copy the ID (in the url, after `folders/`) and add it `DOSSIER_SUIVI`.

Here's what your `.env.local` file must look like at this stage:

```bash
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_secret

# Database
DB_URL="postgresql://your_pg_user:your_pg_password@localhost:5432/your_pg_database_name?schema=public"
DOSSIER_SUIVI=LJHlkj1LjhLEKJhlKJDHlkjhIUY3063hOIU89367IGd
```

### Initialise the database

You know need to initialise your database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

### Node Setup

Then you can install and run the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The code base

### Structure

```
.
├── docs                Folder including documentation, including this file.
├── package.json        File including dependencies and scripts to run (like `npm run dev`).
├── prisma              Folder containing the database (data and schemas)
├── public              Folder containing the static data (images, pdfs, etc.).
├── src                 Folder containing the code (front-end, back-end, requests, api, etc..).
└── tailwind.config.ts  Configuration for tailwind (variables, sizes, etc.).
```

> The non-important files and folders are ignored.

Let's focus on the `src/` folder:

```
.
├── actions             Contains the server actions (e.g. for authentication).
├── app                 Contains the front-end pages of the app.
├── components          Contains the components (see below).
├── db                  Contains the database requests.
├── fonts               Contains the font of the project (`Avenir Next`)
├── lib                 Contains utils for different things
├── middleware.ts       The middleware is executed between the client request and the server response,
                            to handle redirections and check authorisations to access pages.
└── settings            Different settings
```

### Components

Before using a component, please check that it doesn't already exist. See [components.md] for this.
